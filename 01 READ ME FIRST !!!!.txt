ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
THIS IS MY FIRST PROJECT THAT I DEVELOED IN THE SECOND YEAR OF MY COLLEGE. THIS IS A SIMPLE FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM THAT IS CREATED USING PHP, CSS, HTMLand BOOTSTRAP.

STEPS TO FOLLOW:
1. INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO CODE AND XAMPP SERVER IN THE DESKTOP

2. I CREATED FOLDER CALLED xampp FOR INSTALLING ALL THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES
   I PLACED ALL THE PROJECTS IN THE FOLDER CALLED 'htdocs'

3. I THEN OPENED THE XAM CONTROL PANEL, THERE I STARTED TWO MODULES "APACHE" AND "MYSQL"
   WHEN YOU CLICK "ADMIN" OPTION OF "MYSQL" YOU ARE DIRECTED TO THE "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php" WHICH STORES ALL THE DETAILS OF THE DATABASE USED IN THE PROJECT.

4. I HAVE CREATED SEPARATED AGES FOR AN ADMIN AND THE USER.

5. FOR ADMIN AGE OPEN THE GOOGLE CHROME AND TYPE 'http://localhost/foodclub(tastethebest)/admin/admin.php/' for logging in as admin
   AFTER LOGGING IN YOU WILL GET ACCESS TO 'home.php'

6. BUT FOR USER OPEN THE GOOGLE CHROME AND TYPE 'http://localhost/foodclub(tastethebest)/user/login.php/' for logging in as user
   AFTER LOGGING IN YOU WILL GET ACCESS TO 'index.php'


7. I HAVE CREATED A DATABASE AND NAMED IT "foodsys".
